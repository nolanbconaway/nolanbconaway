# Nolan Conaway

>>> Fundamentally curious, I am passionate about turning open questions into data problems (and then solving them). I like building visualizations that compactly make a point, and I like building mathematical models to predict what happens next.

## Experience

Present. **Postdoctoral Research Associate**. University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

- _Advised by Dr. Joseph L. Austerweil_.
- Designed and evaluated a novel mathematical model of concept generation.
- Conducted simulations with hierarchical Bayesian and nonparametric Bayesian models.
- Analyzed results of experiments to extract trends and characterize human behavior.
- Maintained code and facilitated collaboration using Git version control. 
- Designed experiments and collected data using web applications on Amazon Turk.

2011-2016. **Graduate Student**. Binghamton University (SUNY). 

- _Advised by Dr. Kenneth J. Kurtz_.
- Designed a grid-search procedure to differentiate predictions of neural network architectures.
- Conducted simulations with autoencoder, radial basis function, and MLP classifier architectures.
- Identified a novel solution to the linear separability constraint in single-layer neural networks.
- Conducted experiments to provide decisive information for theory evaluation.
- Developed/maintained the official implementation of the Divergent Autoencoder network model.

## Side Projects

**18,000 Pitchfork Reviews**. _Winter 2016 - Spring 2017_.

- Designed Python classes to scrape 16 years of reviews from Pitchfork Media. 
- Stored data in SQL format, analyses focused on uncovering evidence of reviewer bias.
- Published results in Jupyter Notebooks and a blog post.
- _Sample result_. Reviewers statistically heap scores to "round" values (e.g., *.0).


**75,000 Hip Hop Releases**. _Autumn 2016 - Winter 2016_.

- Used an online API to scrape metadata from a major BitTorrent website. 
- Integrated 2010 US census data, conducted analyses describing geographic patterns.
- Published results in Jupyter Notebooks and a blog post.
- _Sample result_. Southern cities (e.g., New Orleans, Atlanta, Memphis) produce the most hip hop, per person.

**CogSci 2016 Shiny App**. _Summer 2016_.

- Addressed the inaccessibility of the conference proceedings (schedule was spread over many pages, no search interface).
- Scraped the online conference schedule, stored the data in a SQL database.
- Quickly designed a Shiny application to provide a searchable schedule interface before the conference started.
