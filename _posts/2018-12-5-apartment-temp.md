Last winter, I felt like my apartment was very cold. I want some hard data to bring to my building's management so that they might turn up the heat. So I hooked up a Raspberry Pi with a temperature sensor to record the temperature every minute.

Here is the [git repo](https://github.com/nolanbconaway/temp-in-nolans-apartment) for the heroku app. The code for the sensor lives on my raspberry pi and is super specific to how that machine is configured. I'll send it your way if you ask.
