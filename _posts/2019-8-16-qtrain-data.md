Casper's offices are moving to FiDi, so I'll be taking the 5 train now. Time to close 
out this data collection process. 

I set up a [slackbot](https://github.com/nolanbconaway/how-was-the-q) to record data from the MTA
realtime API every morning before I left for work, and then to ask about my commute afterwards.

It turns out that I rarely have a "bad" ride (15 across the space of 10 months) so it'll
 prove challenging to forecast them! Regardless, I've compressed the
[json data](/blog/assets/qtrain-data/compressed.json.gz) so anyone can check them out.
