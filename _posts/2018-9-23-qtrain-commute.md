I ride the the Q train most days at about 8AM. I ride it from Parkside ave in Brooklyn to work in midtown Manhattan.

One day I will built a model to predict my ride quality in advance, so that I might use another line if a bad ride is forecasted.

Here is the [git repo](https://github.com/nolanbconaway/how-was-the-q).
